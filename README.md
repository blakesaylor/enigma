# **Enigma - Blake Saylor**

## Self Assessment
* ### Functionality
  * **Expected:** Meets Expectations - 3/4
  * **Justification:** Enigma class is created with working encrypt and decrypt methods. Command line interfaces are implemented for encrypt and decrypt.

* ### Object Oriented Programming
  * **Expected:** Meets Expectations - 3.5/4
  * **Justification:** Module has been implemented in a logic manner to be used both with encrypting and decrypting messages. Module made sense to be used in this case since a large number of the methods being used were identical between encryption and decryption. Inheritance was not utilized in this project. Certain methods within the Enigma class could be rewritten to utilize optional arguments to minimize repeating of code.

* ### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  * **Expected:** Above Expectations - 4/4
  * **Justification:** Classes, methods, and variables are named appropriately so that their function is easily understood. Code is indented properly, syntax is consistent across all areas. No methods are longer than 10 lines and most enumerables are chosen correctly.

* ### Test Driven Development
  * **Expected:** Above Expectations - 4/4
  * **Justification:** All methods are tested, with the majority being unit tests. Integration is tested via the encrypt and decrypt methods which utilize multiple different methods to reach a final product. Stubs are used within tests for generating a random key string and generating a random key hash, which allows for more robust and efficient testing. Obvious edge cases were addressed appropriately. Coverage from SimpleCov shows 100% coverage with stub included. Tests are all written prior to implementation code and rewritten when necessary as additional need for functionality is discovered.

* ### Version Control
  * **Expected:** Above Expectations - 4/4
  * **Justification:** Github repository shows at least 9 pull request and 90 commits, well past the 4 pull request and 40 commits required. History shows that the project was assembled in multiple chunks of different functionality. Branches and chunks were used in the correct manner to describe the process that was being added/modified. Large number of commits were very helpful at several points when functionality of the project was broken and a roll back was needed.
